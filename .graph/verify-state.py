"""Verify that a node actually wrote its key in a run's state.json.

    python graph_agents/.graph/verify-state.py <run-id> <key> [<key> ...]
    python graph_agents/.graph/verify-state.py --audit <run-id>

Exit 0 only if EVERY named key exists and is non-empty. Anything else exits 1 and
names the offending key on stderr. Dotted keys walk nested objects: `reviews.s1`,
`builders.s2`.

`--audit` is the hook-firable half, added 2026-08-26. The named-key mode above can
only run when someone already knows WHICH node just finished, so it can only ever be
called by hand. A PostToolUse hook sees a file path and nothing else, so it cannot ask
that question at all. `--audit` asks the one a lone state.json can answer instead:
given everything written so far, did the graph's EDGES hold? Builders before the human
gate, a review with no build behind it, a fan-in over a slice whose latest review is not
a PASS, a run closed with a slice still unreviewed, a key filled in around template text
still left in place. It names no node and needs no argument beyond the run.

The two modes are complementary, not redundant: `--audit` never reports a key as
merely unwritten mid-run (that is what a run in progress looks like), and the named-key
mode never notices ordering. Keep both.

"Non-empty" is the whole point. A node that wrote `{}`, `[]`, `""`, or a dict whose
values are all empty did NOT do its job. Presence alone is not evidence of work.

Neither is a non-empty PLACEHOLDER. `feature-graph` step 1 opens a run by copying
`_schema.json`, whose values are all descriptive strings, so an untouched key is
non-empty and would sail through. A value byte-identical to the one in the template
is therefore treated as unwritten too. Without this the check is green in exactly
the situation it exists to catch: a run where no node has executed.

This is a checker: pure stdlib, no network, and it never writes.

# supplies the verdict. Two reviewers invented that shape independently and nothing in the
# fleet read it, so a slice that was rejected and then fixed reported as failed -- which is
# why `close-run.py` could not close 2026-09-04-payload-split and why the audit had been
# misreporting 2026-08-25-fleet-hardening since the day it closed.
#
# The rule lives HERE, once, because `close-run.py` and `brief.py` already import this

# deliberately NOT taught about attempts -- it is a dumb dotted-path walker, and a magic
# resolve would silently change every unrelated dotted read in three scripts.

# mirrors, read and copied, never imported: it is a separate app, and importing it would be
# the cross-app edge the umbrella invariant forbids.

# matches that bound EXACTLY on purpose: two readers with different caps disagreeing about
# a verdict, in a place nobody would look, is the precise divergence this rule exists to
# prevent. Where they would silently differ -- attempt_10 and beyond -- this side is loud
