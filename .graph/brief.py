Why this exists. `GRAPH.md` §3 splits a run into two channels and this fills the second
one. `state.json` is the MACHINE channel -- the edge between nodes that cannot see each
other -- and it is deliberately unbudgeted: a builder's `changed` entry runs to a
paragraph per file because the reviewer needs that. The HUMAN channel is the main tab,
and until now it was fed by pasting the machine channel into it. A run then reads as
several thousand words of correct, necessary, unreadable detail.

`--for` is a THIRD channel: not human, not the raw machine file, but the slice of the
machine file one node actually needs to do its job. `state.json`'s "on start" contract
used to mean "read the whole file" -- every node inheriting every other node's context
whether it uses it or not, which on a several-hundred-KB run is tens of thousands of
tokens of keys the node reading them will never touch. A builder does not need the
reviewer's schema comment or another slice's file list; it needs its own plan entry, the
facts that justified it, and -- on a re-run -- what the last review said was wrong.
`--for` derives exactly that, per node type, from the same `state.json` this file has
always read. Nothing here is authored either: same guarantee as the board, smaller slice.

A slice's verdict is its LATEST review attempt, and a slice that got there the hard way
says so -- `review PASS (looped, attempt 2: REJECT -> PASS)`. Both halves are the
requirement: the board must stop reporting a fixed slice as failed, and it must not start
reporting a fixed slice as though it had passed first time.

Nothing here is new information. Every line is DERIVED from `state.json` plus
`activity.jsonl`, both of which the fleet already writes. That is the whole design: a
board no node authors cannot drift from the run, cannot be forged, and costs no node a
single token. The moment a node is asked to write the summary too, it can lie about it
-- the same argument `verify-state.py --audit` makes against trusting a node's own
account of whether it wrote its key.

The placeholder rules live in `verify-state.py` and are imported, not restated: a run
opened from `_schema.json` has non-empty template text in every key, and a board that
read that as work would show a run where nothing has happened as fully built.
`importlib` rather than `import` because the filename is hyphenated -- same reuse as
`.claude/hooks/flag-state-gap.py`.

Read-only, pure stdlib, and it never raises on a partial run: mid-flight, with most keys
still unwritten, is the case it exists for.
