WHAT AN RLM IS
--------------
Zhang, Kraska & Khattab, "Recursive Language Models" (arXiv:2512.24601; blog:
alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/). The root model never reads the long input. It
sits in a REPL as the variable `context`; the root writes code to peek at it, grep it,
partition it, and call a cheaper sub-model over the pieces. Only a constant-size prefix
of each cell's output re-enters the root's history, so the root's window stays clean no
matter how large `context` is. The paper's headline configuration is depth 1 with a
cheaper sub-model (GPT-5 root, GPT-5-mini sub), and that is the shape here:

    # umbrella:begin rlm-root-model
    root model      the node already running (scout, postmortem, an orchestrator)
    # umbrella:end rlm-root-model
    REPL            this script, driven through Bash; state persists between `exec`s
    sub-model       headless `claude -p`, haiku by default, no tools, no settings

WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE PAPER, deliberately
----------------------------------------------
  - `llm_map` runs sub-calls concurrently. The paper names blocking sub-calls as its
    main systems limitation; a thread pool over subprocesses removes it for free.
  - Spend is CAPPED, not just reported. The paper's cost tail comes from trajectories
    that flail; here a session has a dollar budget and a call cap, and every call is
    ledgered with its real `total_cost_usd`. The cap is enforced BEFORE a call, never
    during one: each call reserves a worst-case estimate (`estimate_usd`). A call that
    would pass the budget only because of calls still in flight WAITS for them to
    settle; one that would pass it on money already spent is refused. So concurrency
    cannot overshoot; only a call that costs more than its own estimate can, and the
    ledger records `over_estimate` when that happens.
  - Depth is 1, full stop. A sub-call has no tools, so it cannot open a REPL of its own.

WHY NOT `claude -p --max-budget-usd`, measured 2026-10-06
---------------------------------------------------------
It is checked AFTER the call. A 30KB haiku call capped at $0.003 spent $0.027, then
returned `error_max_budget_usd` with no result: paid in full, answer discarded. Passing
it would only turn an over-budget call into a wasted one. The first live run of this
script did pass it, with each concurrent call handed the whole remaining budget, and a
$0.10 session spent $0.237. That is why the reservation exists.

# umbrella:begin rlm-measured-on
THINKING AND CACHING, measured 2026-10-06 on one 30KB chunk of CURRENT-STATE.md
# umbrella:end rlm-measured-on
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    default effort, cached     $0.051   60s   6466 thinking tokens   answer correct
    thinking off               $0.019    2s      0                   answer WRONG (2 closed
                                                                     gaps listed as open)
    --effort low, no caching   $0.026   28s   2844                   answer correct
    --effort medium, no cache  $0.030   62s   5812                   same answer as low
So the default is `--effort low`, and prompt caching is off (`DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1`):
a one-shot excerpt is never re-read, so a cache write is a 2x input surcharge for
nothing. `effort="none"` turns thinking off for pure extraction where the evidence is
literal (a grep could almost do it); the measurement says do not use it for judgment.

THE SUB-CALL IS ISOLATED FROM THE FLEET, and that is load-bearing
-----------------------------------------------------------------
# umbrella:begin rlm-launched-from
`claude -p` launched from `repos/` would load the fleet's hooks and CLAUDE.md: every
# umbrella:end rlm-launched-from
sub-call would land in the open run's `activity.jsonl` as a phantom node, and pay for the
constitution as input. So each call runs with `--tools "" --setting-sources ""
# umbrella:begin rlm-cwd-outside
--no-session-persistence`, a minimal `--system-prompt`, and a cwd OUTSIDE `repos/` (the
# umbrella:end rlm-cwd-outside
session directory, under the system temp dir). Measured 2026-10-06: the default Claude
Code system prompt costs $0.0105 for a one-word haiku reply; the minimal one, $0.00076.

WHERE IT MUST NOT BE USED
-------------------------
  # umbrella:begin rlm-must-not
  - In `.claude/hooks/**`. A sub-call is a network call; ADR 0001 § 4 holds.
  - By `reviewer`, `architect` or `integrator`. An RLM hands the reading to haiku, and
    those are the nodes GRAPH.md § Model tiering says are never downgraded. A reviewer
    reading a diff through haiku summaries is a laundered review. See
    `decisions/0002-rlm-scope.md`.
  # umbrella:end rlm-must-not

STATE
-----
`$RLM_HOME/<session>/` (default: <tempdir>/graph-rlm/<session>/). Machine-local and
# umbrella:begin rlm-state-root
disposable -- nothing under `repos/` is written, so there is nothing to gitignore.
# umbrella:end rlm-state-root

    context.txt   the loaded input, verbatim
    ns.pickle     the REPL namespace: every picklable variable you assigned
    calls.jsonl   one line per sub-call: model, effort, chars in/out, cost, estimate,
                  seconds, error, and over_estimate when the cost beat the estimate
    final.txt     the answer, written by FINAL_VAR(name)

Variables persist between `exec`s if they pickle. Functions and modules defined in a
cell do not -- redefine them, or keep them in one cell. The skipped names are listed.

TESTING
-------
`RLM_FAKE_LLM=1` swaps the sub-model for a deterministic offline stub that costs
# umbrella:begin rlm-test-ref
$0.001 a call. `test_rlm.py` runs entirely under it.
