"""Machine check for GRAPH.md section 3 rule 3's three-line return cap.

    python graph_agents/.graph/check-return-cap.py [<run-id>]

Read-only report. GRAPH.md section 3 rule 3: "Return a HEADLINE, not the handoff.
Three lines, no verbatim command output, no file lists, no findings bodies... `architect`
and `ops` are the two exceptions: their returns are **gate** material, not status." Prose
since 2026-09-03 (gap #19), with nothing on disk that ever checked it. This is that check.

**Why transcripts, not state.json.** `state.json` carries no return text at all -- rule 2
puts a node's WORK in its own key, and rule 3's return is deliberately something
different: text printed once to the orchestrator's own tab, never written anywhere by the
node itself. `record-activity.py`'s `say` field looks tempting but is not it -- it is a
ONE-LINE, 220-char-capped caption (`record-activity.py` SAY_MAX_CHARS, line 139), built to
be a heartbeat caption, not a verbatim return, and structurally incapable of counting
lines in a return that might itself run to three lines of up to 220 chars each. The only
place the real return text survives is the transcript Claude Code itself writes for that
one agent instance:

    ~/.claude/projects/<encoded cwd>/<session_id>/subagents/agent-<agent_id>.jsonl

That is the same undocumented, internal storage layout `record-activity.py`'s `tokens`/
`say` fields already lean on (see that file's module docstring) -- taken again here,
deliberately, for the same reason: the alternative is not checking the rule at all.
Per `graph_agents/CLAUDE.md` ("copy, don't couple"), the path derivation below is COPIED
from `record-activity.py`, not imported -- a checker importing a hook would inherit the
hook's own failure modes (silent-on-stdin-error, exit 0 always) as its own, which are the
wrong defaults for a script whose whole job is to report a violation with a real exit code.

**What "the return" actually is (attempt-1 defect, fixed here).** A node's return is not
"whatever text it said last" -- it is specifically the `message` argument of its own
`SubagentHandback` tool_use call, the one mechanism that actually delivers text to the
orchestrator's tab (see the node files' own Return sections: "call `SubagentHandback`
... and then stop"). The transcript is a full agent turn log, and a `text` block can
appear before that call (working narration on the way to the handback) or, harness-
permitting, after it (post-handback chatter the orchestrator never received and rule 3
never governed). Attempt 1 took the newest `text` block anywhere in the transcript and
was wrong on live data because of exactly that: it reported 4 and 10 lines for two nodes
whose real, delivered returns were 3 and 2. `last_return_text` below reads the
`SubagentHandback` tool_use's own `message` input and nothing else.

**A found-and-over-cap return is the only failure this reports.** Every other outcome --
no activity.jsonl, an agent_id with no transcript on disk, a transcript with no
`SubagentHandback` call at all (an in-flight lane that has not returned yet, same as
attempt 1's second defect: it must never be certified compliant off an early `text`
block), a torn line mid-transcript -- is `unverifiable`, counted and printed, never a
reason to fail: absence of evidence is not evidence of a violation, the same
silent-on-failure rule `last_said_by` follows. Exit 1 is reserved for a return actually
found on disk and over cap.

**A compliant `state.json` key does not excuse an over-cap return.** The cap protects the
orchestrator's context window, spent the moment the return is printed to its own tab -- a
tidy `builders.<slice>` key written a moment later does not un-spend it. `state.json` is
read here only to confirm the run exists; it is never consulted for return content.

**Never echoes transcript text.** Not one character of the checked prose reaches this
script's own output -- agent type, agent id and line count only. A checker that quotes
what it polices turns every report into the transcript excerpt rule 3 exists to prevent.

Read-only, pure stdlib. Exit 0 unless a real over-cap return is found on disk.
