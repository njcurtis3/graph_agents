"""Heartbeat: append one line per node event to the open run's activity log.

The overseer this fleet wanted is not an agent. A subagent is spawned, runs, returns
text and ends -- there is no loop it could watch from, no channel to its siblings, and a
node that consumes nothing and produces nothing is the fake edge `GRAPH.md` says to
delete. The hook layer, by contrast, already runs alongside every node and is handed
`agent_id` and `agent_type` on every tool event, plus `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop`.

So this writes `.graph/runs/<run>/activity.jsonl`: one compact JSON object per line.

    {"t": 1756209600.4, "ev": "start", "agent": "builder",  "id": "abc123"}
    {"t": 1756209601.9, "ev": "tool",  "agent": "builder",  "id": "abc123", "tool": "Edit", "tokens": 4213, "say": "Adding the retry wrapper around fetchState."}
    {"t": 1756209640.2, "ev": "stop",  "agent": "builder",  "id": "abc123", "tokens": 5890, "say": "Done -- all three call sites now retry."}

Which is enough for four things the fleet could not previously answer:

  live status      what is running right now, and what it just did
  model tiering    GRAPH.md argues cost hard and has never measured it: duration and
                   tool counts per agent_type are the evidence
  independence     a re-review's `SubagentStart` carries a NEW agent_id, which is what
                   makes "a fresh reviewer" checkable rather than merely asserted
  real parallelism when a diamond finally runs, overlapping timestamps are what prove
                   the builders actually ran concurrently

`agent_type` is absent for the main session, so those events are recorded as
`orchestrator` -- it is a participant in the run and its writes belong in the record.

`parent` (`parent_tool_use_id`, when the payload carries one) is recorded too, added
2026-09-09 to diagnose gap #20: 1,411 of 1,496 `stop` events carry an `agent_id` that
never had a matching `start`, are stamped `orchestrator` for lack of `agent_type`, and
interleave with live work rather than clustering at a run's end -- not what "a subagent
finished" should look like. The leading hypothesis is that the harness fires
`SubagentStop` for something that isn't a `Task`-tool spawn -- a backgrounded `Bash`
process, or an internal tool-use agent behind `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` -- and `parent`
is the field that would show a phantom nested under a real node's own `tool_use_id`
rather than orphaned. Unverified; this only logs the field, it draws no conclusion.

`tokens` (added 2026-09-11) is a real, per-agent-id token total -- NOT derived from the
hook payload, which carries no usage field at all (checked against the hooks reference).
Every subagent writes its own transcript to a location Claude Code owns, not this fleet:
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded cwd>/<session_id>/subagents/agent-<agent_id>.jsonl`, one line
per turn, each carrying a real `message.usage` block (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
`cache_creation_input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`). On every `tool` and `stop` event
that carries an `agent_id`, this sums those four fields across every line of that specific
agent's transcript and writes the running total as `tokens` -- a cumulative count for that
one instance, so the last value written is that instance's true final count.

`say` (added 2026-09-11) is the same idea applied to what an agent is actually saying, not
just how much it costs. The same transcript line that carries `message.usage` also carries
`message.content`, a list of blocks -- `text` blocks are the agent's own prose, `tool_use`
blocks are calls. `last_said_by` walks the transcript and keeps the newest `text` block it
finds, collapsed to one line and capped at 220 chars so activity.jsonl stays a heartbeat
log and not a second copy of the transcript. Written as `say` on the same `tool`/`stop`
events as `tokens`, from the same file read -- a snapshot of the latest thing said, not a
running total, so unlike `tokens` a later write simply REPLACES the field rather than
accumulating it.

Both are a real coupling to an undocumented, internal Claude Code storage layout rather
than to any documented hook field -- accepted deliberately (see fleetview's token-counter
work) because the alternative is fabricating a number or a quote, and unwritten if the
layout doesn't match: `tokens_used_by` returns `None` on any read/parse failure and
`last_said_by` returns `None` when no text block is found, and each field is simply
omitted from the line, exactly like every other best-effort field here.

Silent when no run is open or the run is closed. Never blocks, never raises: an
unwritable log must not cost a tool call. Exit 0 always.

    Every node in a run appends to the same `activity.jsonl`, concurrently and from
    separate processes -- a diamond has three builders and three reviewers live at once,
    each firing this hook on every tool call. Buffered text-mode `open(path, "a")` does
    NOT make that safe: the handle carries its own file position and its own buffer, so
    two interleaved appends can land on top of each other.

    That is not hypothetical here. `2026-09-06-bash-write-guard`'s log line 1225 reads
    `"Bash"}` -- the tail of an event whose head was overwritten by another process's
    append. The event it recorded is gone, not merely mangled. Readers (`brief.py`,
    `postmortem.py`) skip unparseable lines, so it cost no crash and left no report; it
    silently subtracted one event from the evidence base those two are built on.

    **`O_APPEND` alone does not fix this on Windows, and believing it did was the first
    attempt.** On POSIX the seek-to-end and the write are one atomic operation; the
    Windows CRT emulates `_O_APPEND` as a seek followed by a write, and the gap between
    them is the whole bug. Measured on this machine, 2026-09-19, four processes appending
    150 lines each to one file: **471 of 600 events survived** -- and with zero torn
    lines, so the loss is invisible to any check that only asks whether each line parses.
    Under the old buffered `open(path, "a")` the same run produced the torn-tail shape
    seen in the real log. Two different symptoms, one cause.

    So the write is serialised by an advisory lock on a sidecar `.lock` file: `flock`
    where there is one, `msvcrt.locking` where there is not. The lock is on a sidecar
    rather than on the log itself because a Windows lock is mandatory, not advisory --
    locking the log would make `brief.py` and `postmortem.py` fail to READ it mid-run,
    turning a write-safety fix into a read outage.

    Failure to take the lock is not a reason to drop the event: after ~1s of contention
    it writes anyway. A log line that might collide is worth more than a node event that
    certainly never existed, and this hook must never be the reason a run stalls.
