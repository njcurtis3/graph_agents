"""What files, if any, is this Bash command about to write?

    from bash_write_targets import classify, has_write_signature
    targets, unresolved = classify(command)

Nothing imports this yet. It exists on its own so that the iterative, likely-to-be-wrong
half of the Bash write guard could be built while `guard-builder-scope.py` -- which is
registered, live, and fails closed -- stayed byte-identical. A half-written guard does not
degrade to "unguarded"; it degrades to every builder write denied, including the write
that would fix it.

THE CONTRACT

  `has_write_signature(command)` -> bool. A cheap regex over the raw string, no parsing
  and no disk I/O. False means the command cannot write anything this file knows how to
  detect WHEN THE COMMAND WORD IS SPELLED PLAINLY -- unquoted and unescaped, in a
  position this anchor recognises. That qualifier is the honest one and it is not
  decoration: the pre-filter is a raw-string anchor while the parser's notion of a
  command word is a post-lexer one, so the superset property is ANCHOR-RELATIVE, not
  structural. See the note above `_COMMAND_POSITION` for which spellings the anchor
  admits and why the claim is still stated at the narrower width. A caller may skip the
  rest on a False -- including whatever state it would have read from disk. `classify()`
  calls it itself, so the two can never disagree: if the pre-filter says no, `classify`
  returns `([], False)` without looking further.

  `classify(command)` -> `(resolved_targets, unresolved_write_shape)`.

    `resolved_targets`  the concrete paths the command will write, in order of first
                        appearance, deduplicated. A path is returned as the command wrote
                        it, with one deliberate exception described under `cd` below.

    `unresolved_write_shape`  True when a write IS present but its target could not be
                        pinned down -- a shell variable that was never assigned in this
                        same command, a `$(...)` substitution, a `git apply` whose targets
                        live inside the patch. Both halves can be true at once:
                        `echo a > kept.txt && echo b > "$SOMEWHERE"` returns one target
                        AND True.

  THIS FILE OWNS NO PATH MATCHER. It returns paths and has no opinion about whether any
  of them is in scope. Matching a target against an approved file set belongs to
  `approved_paths()` / `_match()` in the guard, and that guard has already been fixed
  TWICE for having two matchers that drifted apart. There will not be a third one here.

WHY A `cd` IS APPLIED, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE A TARGET IS NOT VERBATIM

  877 of the 2073 unique Bash commands this fleet has ever run begin with `cd`. Returning
  `GRAPH.md` verbatim for `cd graph_agents && echo x > GRAPH.md` would hand the caller a
  path that resolves against the session root, so the caller would judge `repos/GRAPH.md`
  -- a file that does not exist -- and deny a write the plan had approved. So a `cd`
  earlier in the same command string is joined onto later relative targets. An absolute
  target is never touched. If the `cd` target itself cannot be resolved -- an unresolvable
  operand, `cd -`, or a bare `cd` to the home directory -- later RELATIVE targets become
  `unresolved_write_shape` instead of guesses; `git -C DIR` is handled the same way, for
  that segment only.

  A `cd` reaches the next command only when both run in THIS shell. `( cd x && ... )`,
  a pipeline component and a background job are subshells, and their `cd` dies with them:
  `(cd graph_agents && echo a > a.md) ; echo b > b.md` writes `graph_agents/a.md` and then
  `b.md`, not `graph_agents/b.md`. Leaking a subshell's cwd is not an unresolved flag, it
  is a WRONG resolved path -- indistinguishable downstream from a right one, and pointed
  at denying work the plan approved.

  A brace group is NOT a subshell and does not scope a `cd`, and neither does an `if` or
  a `while` body, so `{ cd graph_agents; echo x > f.md; }` writes `graph_agents/f.md`.
  The keyword in front of the `cd` is stepped over rather than treated as the command --
  see `_COMPOUND_KEYWORDS`, which the pre-filter's anchor mirrors exactly. `cd a || cd b`
  is the one arrangement that resolves to nothing: only one of the two runs, this file
  cannot know which, and composing them into `a/b` names a directory NEITHER branch is
  in, so later relative targets become unresolved.

WHAT IT DETECTS

  redirects           `>` `>>` `>|` `&>` `&>>` `>&` and any fd form (`2>`, `1>>`).
                      `2>&1` and `2>&-` are fd duplications and not files
  heredocs            the body is removed before parsing, so a heredoc that happens to
                      contain `>` or the word `rm` cannot be mistaken for a command; the
                      redirect on the heredoc's OWN line is what makes it a write
  tee                 every file operand, `-a` included
  install             destination, or every operand under `-d`, or `-t DIR`
  dd                  `of=`
  truncate            every file operand
  mv                  destination AND sources -- a move is a write at one end and a
                      delete at the other, and a delete outside the approved set is a
                      modification the guard should see
  cp                  destination only; the sources are reads
  git                 `checkout` / `restore` pathspecs, `apply`; `checkout -b` is a
                      branch, not a write, and neither is `switch`
  sed -i              every file operand, and ONLY with `-i`
  perl -i             the same mechanism spelled by the only other program that has it:
                      `perl -i -pe 's/a/b/' notes.md`, `perl -pi -e ...`. The write is
                      the `-i`, not anything in the `-e` body -- so inspecting the body,
                      which is all this file used to do for perl, returned clean
  rm rmdir touch mkdir ln     every operand
  interpreter bodies  `python -c`, `node -e`, `perl -e`, and `python -` fed by a heredoc:
                      the body is INSPECTED for a write call rather than flagged for
                      being a `-c`. Measured over the corpus: 356 commands use this
                      shape and only 57 of them write. Flagging the shape would invent
                      299 false positives.
  curl / wget         `curl -o FILE`, `curl --output=FILE`, `wget -O FILE`, including the
                      `-sSo FILE` cluster spelling. `-o /dev/null` and `-o -` are not
                      writes. `curl -O` and a bare `wget URL` name their file from the
                      remote resource at runtime, so they are an unresolved SHAPE
  sh -c / bash -c     the body is re-classified as a shell command, depth-limited
  eval                a literal `eval "..."` is re-classified the same way
  $(...) / backticks  the substitution body is walked as a command, so `echo $(rm -rf x)`
                      is the delete it is
  wrapper verbs       `sudo`, `doas`, `env`, `nice`, `nohup`, `command`, `time`,
                      `timeout`, `stdbuf`, `xargs` are stripped and what they wrap is
                      dispatched as itself. `xargs` additionally reports an unresolved
                      shape, because the files it writes arrive on stdin -- and its
                      replace string (`-I{}`, `-i`, `--replace`) is a placeholder, never
                      a resolved target: `xargs -I{} rm {}` is `([], True)`, not `({})`

WHAT IT DOES NOT DETECT, ON PURPOSE, SO THE CALLER CAN SAY SO OUT LOUD

  * A write performed by a program the command merely invokes: `npm run build`, `make`,
    `pytest`, `bash script.sh`, or a script written to an approved path and then run.
    This is the largest hole and it is deliberate -- closing it means denying every test
    command, and a guard that denies pytest is switched off within a day.
  * An obfuscated write: a base64 or `exec` payload inside `python -c`, a target
    assembled from runtime values. `eval` of a VARIABLE is here too -- it comes back as
    an unresolved shape rather than a target, which is a record and not a denial.
  * `powershell`, `awk`'s own `print > file`, `patch`, and a bare `>` written by a program
    the command invokes. Each one added is a new way to deny real work; they are named
    here so the limit is documented rather than discovered. `curl` and `wget` USED to sit
    in this list on the grounds that they were not among the ten evidenced mechanisms.
    Measured, that was simply wrong -- `curl` is in command position 171 times in the
    corpus and 9 unique commands write a literal path with `-o` -- so they moved up to
    the detected list instead. See `_download_targets` for the full breakdown.
  * A write flag the parser reads but a MEASUREMENT could not have shown: this list is
    kept honest by the pre-filter soundness counter in `measure_bash_corpus.py`, which
    asks the parser directly for every command the pre-filter rejected and must print 0,
    and by the spelling sweep in the suite, which asks the same of every command it has
    in five spellings each rather than in the one it was written in.
  * A command word spelled so that the PRE-FILTER's anchor and the parser's lexer
    disagree. A backslash-escaped verb, `'rm'` and `FOO="a b" rm` used to be exactly
    that and are admitted now; `r""m`, `$'rm'` and a line continuation written inside the
    verb are not, and stay missed. (Spelled in words here on purpose: this is a plain
    docstring, and a literal backslash in it is an escape sequence Python reads.)
    They fail OPEN -- no denial, no record -- which is why the claim above `has_write_
    signature` is worded at the width it is, and why it says nothing about quoting.
  * Anything a variable hides that was not assigned in the same command string. There is
    no environment lookup here on purpose: the classifier is pure, so its answer for a
    given string is the same in a test as it is in a hook.

FAILURE DIRECTION. A command this file cannot parse at all comes back as
`([], True)` -- no targets, write shape unresolved. The caller is expected to allow and
record, never to deny on it. A parser that denies what it failed to understand is a
parser that gets routed around.

# The pre-filter. It runs on every Bash call in the session, before the caller touches
# disk, so it is regex over the raw string and nothing more.
#
# It is deliberately a SUPERSET of what the parser below can act on: a false positive here
# costs one state.json read, while a false negative here is a write nobody ever looks at.
# What it must NOT do is fire on the read-only commands this fleet actually runs -- `git
# status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `grep`, `ls`, `wc`, `python -m pytest`, `node test.js` --
# because those are the hot path and they must pay nothing.
#
# THE SUPERSET PROPERTY IS ANCHOR-RELATIVE, NOT STRUCTURAL. What is claimed, and all
# that is claimed: this is a superset over UNQUOTED, UNESCAPED command-position
# spellings. It is written at that width on purpose, because the pre-filter is a
# raw-string anchor and the parser's command position is a post-lexer one -- wherever
# the two can disagree the superset is not a proof but a list, and a list is measured by
# whoever last extended it. An earlier version of this file said STRUCTURAL in capitals
# and 52 of 713 swept spellings leaked past it.
#
# The FLAG half of it really is structural, and that part is worth keeping straight from
# the anchor half. The first version paired a verb with its write flag inside ONE regex,
# separated by a bounded `[^|;&\n]{0,120}` window. Two spellings the parser resolves
# exactly -- `sed --in-place` and `node --eval` -- could not match a window that required
# a single-dash flag, so the guard never saw them while the same commands spelled `-i`
# and `-e` were denied. Decoupling the verb from the flag killed that entire family, and
# no distance, ordering or window length can bring it back.
#
# The ANCHOR half is a list, and these are the entries: a command position, optionally
# behind compound-statement keywords (`{ rm x; }`, `do rm x`), optionally behind `VAR=v`
# assignments whose value may be quoted and contain spaces, optionally behind a directory
# prefix, and optionally quoted or backslash-escaped (`\rm`, `'rm'`, `"rm"`). Those three
# last families were the 52 leaks and they are admitted now; the suite sweeps every
# command in it through all of them rather than sampling. What is NOT admitted, and what
# keeps the claim at "unquoted, unescaped": anything else the shell lexer would fold into
# the same command word -- `r""m`, `$'rm'`, a `\` line continuation between the verb's
# letters. Those are missed writes (fail-open, no denial and no record), 0 in the corpus,
# and outside a cooperative population's failure mode.
#
# So the verb and the flag are searched INDEPENDENTLY now. A paired clause fires when the
# verb appears ANYWHERE in the string and a flag that could make that verb write appears
# ANYWHERE in the string. No distance, ordering, quoting or window length can hide a
# pairing the parser would act on, and each flag pattern is a deliberate superset of the
# predicate the parser uses (`_in_place`, `_output_flag`, the `-c`/`-e`/`--eval` scan).
# The cost is over-firing on `grep -i sed`, and over-firing costs one state.json read.

    The docstring used to name `curl` among the mechanisms this fleet has never used.
    That claim was false in the direction that matters. Read through this file's own
    lexer, `curl` sits in COMMAND POSITION 171 times across the 2078 unique corpus
    commands, and 93 of those invocations carry an output flag: 64 write `/dev/null` and
    drop out at `_is_null_sink`, 16 name a shell variable, and 13 name a literal path
    right there on the command line. By unique command that is 57 / 8 / 9 -- and the 9
    are more real use than `mv` (2) and `touch` (2) combined, both of which are detected.

    THE DURABLE FIGURE, and the one anything downstream should quote, is not any of those
    counts: every one of them is methodology-dependent, moving between 9 and 28 depending
    on whether occurrences or unique commands are counted and whether in-command
    assignments are expanded first. It is the CLASSIFIER DELTA, which two people have now
    reproduced independently over one shared denominator -- adding `curl`/`wget` moves 14
    corpus commands from clean to resolved, gives 3 already-resolved commands another
    target, and moves 1 to unresolved.

    (The review that asked for this counted 28 unique commands. That number is real but
    it is an OCCURRENCE count of non-`/dev/null` output flags, not a command count, and
    the adjudication went that way; roughly half of those occurrences name a variable
    rather than a path. The mechanism is worth detecting on any of the counts.)

    `curl -O` and a bare `wget URL` name the file after the remote resource, which is
    decided at runtime by the URL the transfer ends up at. Those are reported as an
    unresolved SHAPE rather than guessed from the URL: a wrong resolved path is worse
    than an honest unresolved one, because nothing downstream can tell it was a guess.
