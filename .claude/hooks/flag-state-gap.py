"""PostToolUse hook: audit a run's state.json for edge violations the moment it changes.

This is what "fire verify-state.py from a hook" can actually mean. The script's original
mode takes a run id plus the KEY a node was supposed to write, and a hook has no way to
know which node just finished -- it sees a file path. So this fires the script's
`--audit` half instead, which asks the question a lone state.json can answer: given
everything written so far, did the graph's edges hold?

What that turns from convention into machinery (`CURRENT-STATE.md` gap #7):
  - builders written with `approved_by_human` still false -- the human gate skipped
  - a review with no build behind it
  - a fan-in over a slice that never passed
  - a run closed `done` with a slice unbuilt or not PASSed
  - template text left sitting inside an otherwise-written key (blind spot 6)

Deliberately SILENT on a merely half-filled run. Mid-run, most keys are unwritten and
that is exactly what work in progress looks like; a hook that complained on every
intermediate write would be switched off inside a day, and then it checks nothing.

The rule lives in `verify-state.py`, not here -- same reuse as
`flag-cross-app-import.py`. `importlib` rather than `import` because the filename is
hyphenated and not a legal module name.

`repos/.claude` is a junction into `graph_agents/.claude`, so resolve the path before
routing on it, or the hook is silent on half the paths agents actually use.

Exit 0 always -- a hook must never block a legitimate edit.
