"""PreToolUse hook: a builder may not write outside the file set the human approved.

The gate in `feature-graph` step 4 shows a human a plan whose slices name specific
files, and the human approves *that*. Until now nothing checked it afterwards -- a
builder could edit anything in the target and the approval meant only that the run was
allowed to start. This makes the approved file set a boundary instead of a description.

DENIES rather than warns. A warning after the write has already happened is a record of
the violation, not a guard against it, and `PreToolUse` is the only place in this fleet
where a rule can actually stop something.

Scope, stated honestly:

  It compares against the UNION of every slice's `files`, not the acting builder's own
  slice. A hook is given `agent_id`, never a slice id, and nothing maps one to the other.
  In `single-loop` -- which is every run this fleet has executed -- the union IS the one
  slice, so the guard is exact. In a diamond, worktrees already keep builders out of each
  other's trees, so what the union still buys is the plan boundary itself.

  It matches a builder working in a linked git WORKTREE by repo-relative path, since a
  worktree's absolute paths are rooted outside the umbrella and can never equal the
  plan's. The repo is taken to be a plan entry's first path segment, which holds because
  every node under the umbrella owns its own repo. If that ever stops being true the
  entry fails to match and only the absolute rule applies -- the guard narrows, never
  widens.

  It fires only for `agent_type == "builder"`. The orchestrator is not constrained here:
  it is not supposed to be implementing at all, and `feature-graph` says so in words.

  It is silent when there is no open run, when the run is closed, when the plan lists no
  files, and when `approved_by_human` is not yet true -- in that last case a builder
  should not be running, but that is `--audit`'s finding to report, and denying every
  write instead would deadlock a run whose approval simply has not been recorded yet.

BASH IS COVERED TOO, as of 2026-09-06 -- gap #13. Registering this guard on `Write|Edit`
alone meant a builder writing through `sed -i`, a heredoc, `tee`, `python -c` or a plain
redirect left the approved file set entirely: no denial, no record, no trace. The matcher
is `Write|Edit|Bash` now, and `bash_write_targets.classify` resolves what a command is
about to write. Every target it resolves goes through the SAME `approved_paths` /
`covered` / `_match` / `worktree_context` a `Write` goes through -- there is no second
matcher, because this guard has been fixed twice already for having two that drifted.

  What that coverage is NOT. A command whose write shape cannot be resolved -- a target
  behind an unassigned shell variable, a `$(...)` substitution -- is ALLOWED with a
  warning naming it. So is a write performed by a program the command merely invokes:
  `npm run build`, `make`, `pytest`, `bash script.sh`. Both are deliberate. The
  population here is cooperative, and a guard that denies `pytest`, or denies what it
  merely failed to parse, is switched off within a day and then closes nothing at all.
  The warning is the point in those cases: gap #13's complaint was "no record", and a
  record is what the unresolved branch leaves.

  A Bash write to a temp directory or to `/dev/null` is allowed and not reported. Those
  are sinks, not the tree the plan is about. `bash_write_targets` drops the null sinks
  itself; the temp roots are dropped here, and deliberately NOT added to the approved
  set, so a `Write` tool call to a temp path is denied exactly as it was before.

The escape hatch is `scope_exceptions` in the run's `state.json`, which the orchestrator
owns. Adding a path there is deliberate and auditable; editing `architect.plan` to widen
the file set would be the orchestrator rewriting another node's key, which is exactly
what `written_by` was added to catch.

Exit 0 always. Printing no JSON means "no opinion" and the tool proceeds normally.

It FAILS CLOSED, as of 2026-09-02. The silences above are deliberate and stay allows,
but an unexpected exception emits a deny that names this file as broken, rather than
letting a guard that never ran read as a guard that approved. See `main()`.

    """Fail CLOSED, and only for builders.

    Everything `decide()` returns early on is a deliberate silence and stays an allow.
    An *unexpected* exception is different: it means the guard did not run, and a guard
    that cannot run must not pretend it approved something. Before 2026-09-02 a crash
    here was indistinguishable from "no opinion" -- `main()` swallowed every exception
    and `settings.json` wrapped the call in `2>/dev/null || true` -- so a syntax error
    in this file did not block builders, it silently stopped guarding them, voiding the
    human gate for a whole run with nothing to show for it afterwards.

    The two failure directions are not symmetric. Failing closed blocks ONLY builders
    (the `agent_type` check above exempts the orchestrator and every other node), says
    exactly what broke, and is fixed in a minute. Failing open silently voids a human
    approval and leaves no trace. So: deny, loudly, naming this file as the problem.

    This is also why `bash_write_targets` is imported inside `decide()` rather than at
    module top: an import that fails up there is not caught here at all.

    A malformed payload is the one case still treated as an allow: without a parseable
    payload there is no `agent_type`, so the deny could not be scoped to builders and
    would block every agent in the session. That is the harness's contract to keep, not
    this guard's to enforce.
